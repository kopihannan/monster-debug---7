                        Difference Between Local Storage, Session Storage

                    <div class="accordion-body">Local Storage: This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).

                        DOMStrings are storage formats that use UTF-16 to encode data, which uses two bytes per character. Strings are automatically generated from integer keys just as they are for objects. The data stored in LocalStorage is specific to a protocol in the document. If the site is loaded over HTTP (e.g., http://example.com), localStorage returns a different object than if it is loaded over HTTPS (e.g., https://abc.com).
                        
                        If a document is loaded from a file: URL (that is, directly from the user’s local file system instead of being loaded from the server) the requirements for behavior are undefined and may vary among different browsers. Each file appears to be returned a different object by localStorage in all current browsers: URL. Essentially, it seems to be a case of each URL: file having its own unique local storage area.
                        
                        This behavior cannot be guaranteed because as mentioned above, the file: URL requirements remain unclear. As such, there’s a possibility that browsers may change how they handle files at any time. The way some browsers handle it has evolved. <br><br>
                    Season Storage: Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

                    A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the browser is open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session is created each time a tab or window is opened; this is different from session cookies. Each tab/window that is opened with the same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage from the original tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and clears sessionStorage objects.
                    
                    A page’s protocol determines what data is stored in sessionStorage. Particularly, data stored by scripts accessed through HTTP (for example, http://abc.com) is stored in a separate object from the same site accessed through HTTPS (for instance, https://abc.com). A DOMString number is two bytes per character in UTF-16 DOMString format. Strings are automatically generated from integer keys just as they are for objects.

                    <div class="accordion-body">Global Scope:  The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable. <br><br>
                        Block Scope: 
                        Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

                        Imagine a nested situation:
                        A block of code enclosed with curly brackets{} containing some block variables.

                        What is an event loop in JavaScript ?

                    <div class="accordion-body">Event loop: An event loop is something that pulls stuff out of the queue and places it onto the function execution stack whenever the function stack becomes empty.



                        The event loop is the secret by which JavaScript gives us an illusion of being multithreaded even though it is single-threaded. The below illusion demonstrates the functioning of event loop well:
                        
                        
                        
                        Here the callback function in the event queue has not yet run and is waiting for its time into the stack when the SetTimeOut() is being executed and the Web API is making the mentioned wait. When the function stack becomes empty, the function gets loaded onto the stack as shown below:
                        
                        
                        
                        That is where the event loop comes into picture, it takes the first event from the Event Queue and places it onto the stack i.e in this case the callback function. From here, this function executes calling other functions inside it, if any.
                        
                        
                        
                        This cycle is called the event loop and this how JavaScript manages its events.</div>

                    <div class="accordion-body">The undefined type
                        The undefined type is a primitive type that has only one value undefined. By default, when a variable is declared but not initialized, it is assigned the value of undefined.
                        <br>
                        Consider the following example:
                        <br>
                        let counter;
                        console.log(counter);        // undefined
                        console.log(typeof counter); // undefined
                        Code language: JavaScript (javascript) <br><br>
                        In this example, the counter is a variable. Since counter hasn’t been initialized, it is assigned the value undefined. The type of counter is also undefined.
                        
                        It’s important to note that the typeof operator also returns undefined when you call it on a variable that hasn’t been declared:
                        <br>
                        console.log(typeof undeclaredVar); // undefined</div>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
        </div>
